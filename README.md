### Challenges

1. [Fallback](#01---fallback)
2. [Fallout](#01---fallout)

## 01 - Fallback

To solve this challenge we need to calaim the contract's ownership and withdraw all its balance.

In order to take the `ownership`, we have **two possible ways**:

1. We send some ethers to the contract, as updating the `owner` state is set on the `receive` fallback

   ```solidity
   receive() external payable {
       require(msg.value > 0 && contributions[msg.sender] > 0);
       owner = msg.sender;
   }
   ```

   Before doing that, we need first to satisfy the condition `contributions[msg.sender] > 0`, to do so, we can just call the function `contribute()` and send at least `1 wei`.

2. We call the `contribute()` function and send an amount of ether that is **greater** than the contribution of the owner, as updating the owner is set if that condition is satisfied:

   ```solidity
    if(contributions[msg.sender] > contributions[owner]) {
       owner = msg.sender;
    }
   ```

After that, we can call the `withdraw` to take all the contract's balance.

## 02 - Fallout

To pass this challenge, we need to take the contract's ownership. <br/>

In old Solidity versions, to create a constructor function, we could declare a function **with the same name of the Contract**. In this challenge, the constructor's function name has a _typo_ error, instead of `Fallout`, they set `Fal1out`. <br/>To take the ownership, we can just call the function `Fal1out()`

```
NOTE: after trying to run the challenge test, you may get an error saying that File @openzeppelin/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol, imported from contracts/Fallout.sol, not found.
, it is maybe because the Math library is deleted from Openzeppelin in newer versions, you can just downgrade the openzeppelin package in package.json
```
